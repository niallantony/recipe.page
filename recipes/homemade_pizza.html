        <ul>
            <li>Strong Flour 3 cups</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Tomato Pasata</li>
            <li>Mozarella Cheese</li>

        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make the dough a couple of hours in advance. Mix yeast with one and a half cups of water and let it soak for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the flour to a mixing bowl and combine with one tablespoon of fine salt.</li>
            <li>Add the water to the flour slowly, mixing to combine into a dough. Add two tablespoons of olive oil too </li>
            <li>Knead until a smooth and bouncy dough is formed. Oil another mixing bowl, add the dough ball and let rise for 1 hour</li>
            <li>After the dough has doubled in size, knead a little more and form into two balls. Cover and let rise for another 30 minutes</li>
            <li>Preheat a heavy baking tray or pizza stone in the oven. </li>
            <li>Take each ball of dough and work it into a thin disk. Begin using a rolling pin and then tease it wider with your hands</li>
            <li>Spread a couple of spoons of tomato pasata on top, sprinkle with Mozarella cheese and add leaves of basil</li>
            <li>Put either directly onto the tray/pizza tone, alternatively sprinkle a little semolina flour and put on top of that</li>
            <li>Cook for ten minutes and eat hot</li>
        </ol>
